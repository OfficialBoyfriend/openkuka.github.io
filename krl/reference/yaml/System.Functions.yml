        The function `StrCopy()` can be used to copy the contents of a string variable to another string variable.
    code-sample:
      krl: |
        DECL CHAR A[25], B[25]
        DECL BOOL C
        A[] = ""
        B[] = "Example"
        C   = StrCopy(A[], B[])
      output: |
        A[] = "Example" 
        and C = true
